    <p>Classic Fruit Salad</p>
    <br>
    <p>Fruit salad is a classic side dish that’s perfect for almost any occasion. Along with this Berry Fruit Salad recipe, this fruit salad is one of our very favorites. It’s bursting with fresh fruits and perfect for serving at a summer BBQ. This recipe features a rainbow of fruits and a sweet fruit salad dressing. The combination of ingredients in this recipe make for a delicious and colorful salad. You can swap in your favorite fruits and adapt this recipe to use what is in season. The honey lime dressing is light and fresh and we use just enough to add an extra zip of flavor to our fresh fruit. We can’t get enough of this fresh fruit salad. The recipe makes a big bowl, which is a good thing because it always gets eaten in record time!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups 1% milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar (reduce to 3 tablespoons for less sweet dressing)</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons corn starch</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla</li>
        <li>2 cups fresh strawberries, quartered (260 grams)</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh blueberries (150 grams)</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh blackberries (135 grams)</li>
        <li>1 cup mandarin oranges canned, drained of juice (189 grams or 284ml can)</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh pineapple chunks (155 grams)</li>
        <li>1 cup red grapes (173 grams)</li>
        <li>2 kiwi peeled and sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium skillet, whisk together milk, sugar and corn starch. Cook over medium-low heat, whisking constantly, until thickened, about 8-10 minutes (it won't be thick like pudding, it is a dressing — but it will thicken considerably).</li>
        <li>Stir in vanilla. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature (you can speed this up by refrigerating for 30 minutes).</li>
        <li>In a large bowl combine strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, oranges, kiwi, pineapple and grapes. Whisk the cooled dressing and pour over fruit. Toss to coat (be gentle — you don't want mush!).</li>
        <li>Serve at room temperature or chill to serve later. If making ahead, only add the dressing 1-2 hours before serving.</li>
    </ol>
